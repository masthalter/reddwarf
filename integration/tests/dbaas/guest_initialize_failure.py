# TODO(tim.simpson): Tests are needed for the following cases:
#
# When provisioning an instance:
# A volume fails to provision:
#     This can be because there is not sufficient space or the account limits
#     are exceeded. There is anothet trickier third case where the volume
#     might be provisioning but is timed out, and must be deleted.
#   In these cases the status must be FAIL. No resources should be counted
#     against the user's account, unless it was via a time-out (this is so the
#     volume can finish creating and we can look at it). However when deleted
#     the volume should also be deleted, and after this point not count against
#     the user's quotas.
#
# The compute instance fails to provision, as an error occurs. The state must
#     be set to FAIL. In this case the compute instance is set to suspended
#     but not deleted (if it even exists in any state) so this may or may not
#     count against a user's quotas
#   When deleted the instance should vanish along with the volumes and all
#     quotas be returned to where they were before.
#
# The guest install times out. In this case the state must be set to FAIL and
#     must stay there! When delete is called, the instance and volume should
#     dissappear.
#
# In addition to GETs and LISTs returning FAIL as the state, attempts to
# add databases should fail.


#TODO: Change volume timeout to something very low, and make sure the instance
# is set to fail.  If it isn't possible to make sure the volume never
# provisions this could also be a reaper test.
